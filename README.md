# Pillionaire

Check if your name is in the first 1 billion numbers of pi. 
By using the position of the letters in the alphabet it creates a sequence to 
search for in pi.

To run you have to download the `pi-billion.txt` from 
[https://stuff.mit.edu/afs/sipb/contrib/pi/](https://stuff.mit.edu/afs/sipb/contrib/pi/)

Once they are in the same folder you can just run:
```
./pillionaire.py NAME
```
